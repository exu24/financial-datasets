In addition, we believe that our revenue growth depends upon a number of factors, including:\u2022global macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and rising interest rates and recessionary concerns;\u2022our ability to retain and grow the number of guests and Nights and Experiences Booked;\u2022our ability to retain and grow the number of Hosts and the number of available listings on our platform;\u2022events beyond our control such as pandemics and other health concerns, restrictions on travel and immigration, political, social or economic instability, including international disputes, war, or terrorism, trade disputes, economic downturns, and the impact of climate change on travel including the availability of preferred destinations and the increase in the frequency and severity of weather-related events, including fires, floods, droughts, extreme temperatures and ambient temperature increases, severe weather, and other natural disasters, and the impact of other climate change on seasonal destinations;\u2022competition;\u2022the legal and regulatory landscape and changes in the application of existing laws and regulations or adoption of new laws and regulations that impact our business, Hosts, and/or guests, including changes in short-term occupancy, tax laws, and real estate broker laws;\u2022the attractiveness of home sharing to prospective Hosts and guests;\u2022the level of consumer awareness and perception of our brand;\u2022our ability to build and strengthen trust and safety on our platform and among members of our community;\u2022the level of spending on brand and performance marketing to attract Hosts and guests to our platform;\u2022our ability to grow new offerings and tiers and to deepen our presence in certain geographies;\u2022timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades to our platform and infrastructure;\u2022the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemic or epidemic and its impact on the travel and accommodations industries; and\u2022other risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A softening of demand, whether caused by events outside of our control, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, challenging macroeconomic conditions, changes in Host and guest preferences, any of the other factors described above, or in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or otherwise, may result in decreased revenue and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.",
